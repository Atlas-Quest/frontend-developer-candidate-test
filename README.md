# SeaLink Travel Group - Front-end Developer code test

## Task brief

1. [View the design file in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/LvtDr9iovqG4Uh6ELYU5Fb/SeaLink-Travel-Group-Front-end-Developer-code-test-Design?node-id=2%3A67)
2. Using a mobile-first development approach, we'd like you to build the 'What's on' component from the Figma design
  
3. Specs of this component:
    * There are a limit of 3 events shown.
    * Event items are displayed as accordions. The first item loads in an active (open) state.
    * Each event item has an image, when the item is active the relevant image swaps in.
    * Each event item has a link, plus there is one general button in the component (use placeholder links).

## Getting the project running

1. Fork our repository to your own Github account
1. Install dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). `cd` into the `/src` directory and run `yarn install`.
1. Once dependencies have been installed, run `yarn start` to compile SCSS and Javascript. This will actively watch for any changes you save.
1. To run a simple webpack server, in a new terminal tab from the `/src` directory run `yarn server`. The app should open at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Local Development

Once you have the project running as per the steps above, you're ready to start development.

1. Our boilerplate has you started with [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) installed, and provided you with some starter SCSS, such as colours and fonts – `/src/scss/app.scss`
1. `/src/js/app.js` is where you can add your custom JavaScript.
1. As mentioned above, Webpack will re-build SCSS or JS as you save changes (compiled to `/app/dist/`).
1. There are 3 images available to use, located in the `/app/images` directory.

## Solution

We'll let you decide how you wish to create the component. There is no right or wrong answer here.
